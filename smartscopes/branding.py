"""The fork's app name, applied at startup without editing upstream files.

Upstream hard-codes "Astro Dwarf Session" in ~14 places across 11 files
(page titles, native window title, PWA manifest, iOS home-screen title).
Instead of patching each one - and conflicting whenever upstream edits
those lines - apply() rewrites the name where it is *used*:

  * every browser-tab title goes through nicegui's Client.resolve_title();
  * the native window title comes from the one ui.run() call;
  * the install name comes from components.pwa's manifest dict and the
    iOS apple-mobile-web-app-title meta tag.

The dashboard wordmark is literal HTML in pages/dashboard.py and uses
brand_html() through a marked hook line there.
