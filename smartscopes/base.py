"""The driver contract every non-Dwarf smart telescope implements.

A driver is a *blocking* object: every method may take seconds (a goto)
or minutes (an autofocus) and is always called from a worker thread,
never from the NiceGUI event loop directly (UI code goes through
nicegui.run.io_bound). Keeping drivers synchronous keeps them easy to
write and test against a plain TCP/HTTP device, whatever its protocol.

Adding a new telescope family = subclass ScopeDriver, declare its
models/capabilities, and decorate it with @register_driver (see
smartscopes/registry.py and smartscopes/drivers/seestar/ for a full
example). The program runner and the UI only ever talk to this
interface, and skip any program step whose Capability a driver doesn't
declare.
